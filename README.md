# Computer_Vision_2024
Courseworks for Computer Vision 2024 (Spring Term)

## Getting Started

Set up a virtual environment, and install Jupyter-Lab:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install jupyterlab
```

Alternatively, install Jupyter Notebook by running the command: `pip3 install notebook`.

Finally, to complete and run the code, use the command `jupyter-lab` or `jupyter-notebook`, depending on which library you installed.

## Installing Libraries

In general, to install any libraries used in this coursework, run the command: `pip3 install [package_name]`.

I've set up a `requirements.txt` file, so install all relevant libraries before launching Jupyter, using the command: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
